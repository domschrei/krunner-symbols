<hr/>
**Note:** This is a Plasma 6 port of the plugin. You can find the Plasma 5 version [here](https://github.com/domschrei/krunner-symbols/tree/master).
<hr/>

A little krunner plugin (Plasma 5) to retrieve unicode symbols, or any other string, based on a corresponding keyword.

![Demonstration "lambda"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domschrei/krunner-symbols/master/img/demonstration1.png)

E.g. you can type `lambda` and krunner will yield the proper unicode symbol Î». It can be used to quickly get a symbol when writing some text, or to retrieve often-needed texts (or links, or emotes ...) by typing a certain abbreviation.

![Demonstration "fliptable"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domschrei/krunner-symbols/master/img/demonstration3.png)

By default, the plugin searches the full Unicode database for potential matches. It is also possible to let the plugin open some file or URL or to execute some command when selecting a result.

The definitions for all these use cases can be freely configured (see *Configuration*).


## Installation

There are scripts to install the plugin in packaged form (i.e., without building it yourself) but these are **not yet functional** for Plasma 6.
```
bash install.sh
bash uninstall.sh
```

## Building

**Quick build and install** after installing the required depencencies (see below):

```
git clone https://github.com/domschrei/krunner-symbols.git; cd krunner-symbols; bash build_and_install.sh
```

This executes the plugin's install script inside the `krunner-symbols` directory. Some dependencies are required, see below for your distribution. If your distribution is not listed and you get an error, the output from `cmake` will give an indication for which package is missing.

**Arch Linux**

`sudo pacman -S krunner qt6-base ki18n qt6-5compat qt6-declarative ktextwidgets libplasma`
`sudo pacman -S cmake extra-cmake-modules qt6-tools jq #these can be uninstalled after building`

_Note that there is a `plasma5-runners-symbols` [package from AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/plasma5-runners-symbols/ "link to AUR package"), but it is unfortunately not kept up to date._

**Debian / Ubuntu**

Debian support will be added ASAP after Plasma 6 enters Debian Testing.

**openSUSE**

Start with these dependencies (see [this post](https://github.com/domschrei/krunner-symbols/pull/26#issuecomment-2142624565)):

`sudo zypper install kf6-krunner-devel kf5-kservice-devel kf6-ktextwidgets-devel libKF5Plasma5 libplasma6-desktoptheme libplasma6-devel plasma-framework plasma6-workspace-libs`

**Fedora**

`sudo dnf install cmake extra-cmake-modules kf6-ki18n-devel kf6-kservice-devel kf6-krunner-devel kf6-ktextwidgets-devel gettext qt6-qtdeclarative-devel qt6-qt5compat-devel libplasma-devel`


## Usage

Open krunner and enter the keyword for what you want to copy. Click on the desired entry tagged with *Symbols* or press Enter while focusing it (navigating with arrow keys). krunner disappears and the result has been copied to your clipboard. With `Ctrl+V`, you can paste it anywhere.

Use double quotation marks to enclose a string with empty spaces that you want to match exactly. Otherwise, inexact matches will be shown as well based on a simple heuristic.

You can use the plugin as some more general form of alias-resolver (i.e. entering some keyword in order to get the corresponding text) and as a general shortcut app by editing the configuration file appropriately.


## Configuration

**TL;DR:** Look at the file `krunner-symbolsrc` and you will get the idea. Store custom stuff in `~/.config/krunner-symbolsrc`.

Additional to the primary source `/usr/share/config/krunner-symbolsrc`, you can create a second file `~/.config/krunner-symbolsrc` for custom, additional definitions. Those definitions will override those inside the global config, so that you can give a new meaning to globally defined symbols, if you wish. Keep in mind that you will have to restart krunner (`bash restart-krunner.sh`) for configuration changes to take effect.

The syntax is easy (you can just copy from the file `krunner-symbolsrc` from the downloaded git directory). Define custom symbols below a config group called "Definitions":
```
[Definitions]
```
For custom definitions, just create lines like this:
```
Keyword=Output
```
, where `Keyword` is what you have to type and `Output` is what you get when typing it. They can be entire sentences, or just single symbols. Comments with `#` and blank lines are ignored.

Multiple keywords for the same result can be expressed like this:
```
ampersand,fancyand,curlyand=&
```
which will internally be expanded to this:
```
ampersand=&
fancyand=&
curlyand=&
```

The plugin is not only able to copy strings to your clipboard, but also to open URLs and documents (with `open:`) and execute commands (with  `exec:`). Here are some examples:

```
# Open the KDE homepage in the standard browser
kde=open:https://www.kde.org/

# Open this plugin's configuration in the standard text editor
config=open:~/.config/krunner-symbolsrc

# Open the folder Documents in the standard file browser
doc=open:~/Documents

# Execute the given command (here: restart krunner)
kill=exec:killall krunner && krunner
```

If selected, the plugin will try to open or execute the specified location or command, using the corresponding default application. Using these types of definitions is obviously at your own risk, as harmful commands might be executed if the config file is set up accordingly.

### Unicode Support

This plugin supports the Unicode database, i.e. [all symbols inside the official UnicodeData.txt](http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/UnicodeData.txt) can be retrieved by entering (parts of) the corresponding description for the symbol. This feature is enabled by default, however there is some performance overhead of searching all the unicode domain that may be noticeable on weaker systems. You can disable it by setting `UseUnicodeDatabase` to `false` inside the `[Preferences]` group of your config file (and then restarting `krunner`):

```
[Preferences]
UseUnicodeDatabase=false
```

This large database also contains a lot of emojis and pictograms (try `thumbs up`, `cat face` or `snowman`).


## Remarks

krunner is a great tool because it's always accessible, very fast, and really unintrusive, as it temporarily gets focused when called but then returns the focus to the previously focused view when finished. Because of this, a quick krunner query can be perfectly integrated into a user's workflow, adding efficiency and convenience. This little tool is meant to support this idea of usage.
